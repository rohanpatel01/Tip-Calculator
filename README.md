# Tip-Calculator
This is a tipping calculator. It gieves you a variety of information such as the total tip, tip per person, final bill (with tip), and the final bill per person (including tip). The next time you go out to a restaurant this tool will be very handy!

This calculator doesn't factor in tax so be aware of that.

When you first open this program you will see 2 sections of information. The left column will be all the input, and the right hand side will be all the information based on the input.
Enter in your initial bill, without the tip. Enter in the number of people, including yourself. Finally enter the amount you wish to tip as an integer. (Ex: Tip 8% will look like 8 in the text box)
After that you will be able to see all the information on the right column after clicking on the calculate tip button.
